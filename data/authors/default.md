Jakeydmonkey, also known as Jake Underland, is the author of the courses on this website. Raised in Tokyo, Japan in a bicultural setting, he is fluent in Japanese and English.  
Jake is a firm believer in [the push towards free and open knowledge](https://custodians.online/). Below is an excerpt from the linked manifesto: 
> In Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry's tale the Little Prince meets a businessman who accumulates stars with the sole purpose of being able to buy more stars. The Little Prince is perplexed. He owns only a flower, which he waters every day. Three volcanoes, which he cleans every week. '**It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them,' he says, 'but you are of no use to the stars that you own**'.   

Many try to make a business out of privatising knowledge that is **borne of publicly funded research conducted by researchers educated in public institutions**. The wealth of knowledge is not something whose proprietorship can be clearly established. We all contribute to the pool of knowledge; we should all be entitled to enjoy its fruits.  
The resources provided in this website, being themselves an accumulation of knowledge gained from various sources and teachers in Jake's lifetime, are made public to all in accordance with these beliefs.
