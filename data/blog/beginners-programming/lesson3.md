# Skeleton Code and Teacher Solution  

- [Skeleton Code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/872570724/)  
- [Teacher Solution](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/842518256/)

# Coding the Game  

- Make a remix of the skeleton code.  

- Choose a sprite costume you like!

- Go to the following section of the code. Can you add code to make the Sprite jump? Hint: use the following: `repeat 10` `change y by 10` `change y by -10`.

- Once you've done that, you can even add blocks to make your sprite make a sound for every jump! Can you do that?   

- Another challenge, can you add code to make the sprite move left and right?
