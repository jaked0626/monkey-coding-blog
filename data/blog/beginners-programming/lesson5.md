# Lesson Materials  

- [Maze Skeleton Code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/853573547/)

- [Teacher Code Demo](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/853564227/)

# Instructions  

- Go to the skeleton code and make a remix of the project.  

- Code the basic movements of the scratch^[**Caution**: if you want to change your scratch, you must copy all the code from the current scratch and add it to the code of your new scratch] (up, down, left, right). Remember the dodgeball project you made!  

- Add your own stages to the maze by clicking `Add Backdrop` and drawing the maze outlines. 
    - Maze lines must be black.  
    - The goal must be neon green (copy the circle of the backdrop provided in the skeleton code). 

- Make your maze, and try to solve each other's mazes!!!
