# Intro  

Last week, our students were given the time to explore projects on Scratch made by a community of their peers (you can explore some of these projects [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all)). They were particularly interested in the following project:

I instantly saw how this project utilizes key concepts in programming such as loops, if statements, variables, and even randomization. 
So, we decided to use the rest of our classes to build a game much like this one.  

# Part 3: Building a Rocket  

Time to spice up our game a bit! Let's build another obstacle to avoid to make the game a little more difficult.  

## First things first  

- Go to [the teacher's project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/866065392/) and test play the game. This is what you will be building today.   
- Now go to [the skeleton code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/866075838/) you will be modifying. You can test it out by playing it. Notice how it's different from the teacher's project? It's your job to complete the code to make it work the same as the teacher's.  
- Make a Remix of the project.
