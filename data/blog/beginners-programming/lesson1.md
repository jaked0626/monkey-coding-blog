# Lesson 1  

## Welcome to the Course!  

In this course we will be learning the basics of *programming*.   
The outline of the course is:  
- What is programming? (How a computer interprets programs).  
- Let's write programs! (Scratch).  
- Moving on with more programs (Python).  
- How do people solve problems with code? (Python, algorithms).  

Now...  

## First Things First.  

In this course we will be working closely with each other. So, let's begin by introducing ourselves.  
I want each of you to share your name, your age, your favorite food, and one way in which you interacted with a computer program this week. But, you can't say something someone else has already mentioned, so try and get creative and think of all the ways in which you use computer programs in your life.    
Ok, I'll start.   
My name is Jake, I am 22 years old, and my favorite food is pancakes but mainly the maple syrup. When I eat pancakes I use a whooooole bottle of maple syrup and make sure to get the pancakes nice and soggy. MMMM, delicious. You're not allowed to do that cuz your parents might get mad at you, but I'm a grownup so I'm allowed to pour a whole bottle of maple syrup on my pancakes. Nah im just kidding, my mom still yells at me for that, too. Anyways, one way in which I interacted with code this week... well, I'm a programmer so I write and read and use code all the time, but one example is on my way here I took the train and went through the gate with my Suica. That's an example of a hugeee computer program that a lot of people use everyday.  
Ok, now let's start from you and go in a circle.  

## What Is Programming?  
Ok, we've talked a little bit about computer programs now and all of you have given excellent examples of how we use computer programs in our daily lives. Now comes the big question....  
<center><strong>What is a computer program?</strong></center>
Can anyone answer that?   

<center>*Hear student answers*</center>
Ok, good!!! We had a couple really good answers there. Now, when put really simply, computer programs are the following:

```
Which brings us to our next point, and this is an important one:  

## Computers Are DUMB!  

Computers are really really dumb. Really dumb. How many of you find that surprising? Right? Let me explain this a little bit. Computers are really good at following orders. If you give them clear instructions, they're able to follow them very well. But, that's the important thing, and that's why people like me, programmers, are able to find jobs, because it's not always easy to give easy, clear instructions.  

```text
Rule: Computers are dumb, so your instructions (programs) need to be very clear.  
```
For example, computers are really good at counting. If you asked people to stand at the gates of the station and count every person that goes inside and outside, that's gonna be a very difficult task, right? Well, for a computer, that kind of thing is easy. BUT, let's imagine instead we ask something a little bit more complicated. Let's ask the computer to not only count the people that go in and out, but also high five everyone wearing a red shirt. Now, a person can do this easily, right? You guys can find everyone wearing a red shirt and high five them? A computer can do this too, but suddenly it's much more difficult. To teach a computer to high five everyone in a red shirt, you need to:
1. Teach the computer *what the color red is*. 
2. Teach the computer *what a shirt is*. 
3. Teach the computer what a *high five is*. 
4. Tell the computer to look at every person's shirt, find the red shirts, and high five them.  

You can't just tell the computer to high five every red shirt, you need to treat the computer like the dumb baby that it is, and teach it everything it needs to know to complete the task.  

Now, let's do a little exercise. My friend Ilya is going to hide my phone somewhere in the classroom, and I want you all to watch where he puts it. You guys are going to give me instructions on where to find my phone, but here's the catch. I'm going to act like a dumb computer, so you need to make sure you give me CLEAR instructions on how to go and get my phone, ok? This is going to be the first computer program that you guys produce. I will be the computer, and you're gonna be my program. How's that sound? 

## What Is a Programming Language?   

![programming languages are just like human languages](/static/images/beginners-programming/lesson1/languages1.jpg)

Now we move on to *programming languages*. This is what we will be writing in our class.  
What is a programming language? Can anyone answer that? Does anyone know any examples of programming languages?  
<center>*ask students*</center>   

Great! Thank you for all of your answers. Programming languages are a bit tricky. How can there be so many languages that a computer understands? Well, this is similar to how our human, verbal languages work. Look at the image at the beginning of this section. There are many different languages that us humans speak, but when we *understand* a language, we're not just thinking of the word that we receive, we're thinking about the *idea* that that word points to. For example, when I say "apple", you're not just thinking about the word "apple" in your head, you're imagining a nice, red, (or green, or yellow), delicious, juicy fruit. Once you can picture that in your head, you can say that you *understand* me when I say "apple". Computers are the same. Computers, when they *understand* code, it means they are able to transform it into a set of instructions written *only in 1s and 0s*. To understand a program means to translate a program into very simple operations that can be described only with these two numbers. Now, we're not gonna get into the details of this, but you might ask, why don't all programmers just write code directly in 1s and 0s? Well, that's kind of like me drawing a picture of an apple to you instead of saying the word *apple*, every time. I can do it, but it's much easier for me to just say the word "apple". Similarly, programming languages makes giving instructions to computers *simple*. It lets you speak to a computer without writing in only 1s and 0s (which is incredibly difficult!).
